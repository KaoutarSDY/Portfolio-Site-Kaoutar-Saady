      <h2>Hello, My name is Kaoutar Saady.
        I have a master's degree in intercultural management and international business from the University of Haute Alsace in France. 
        I have worked as an employer branding and talent acquisition manager with an IT and Tech focus. 
        During these years I was able to improve my communication skills, problem solving and above all take charge of projects and implement strategies from start to finish.
        
        As a manager in charge of recruitment and social networks I loved to promote the company's image through different publications. However, I quickly felt a lack of design knowledge when I had to create publications. I also wanted to understand the users of the networks and the website in order to produce content that would interest them. 
        When I started studying UI and UX I realized how essential understanding users is to produce good content. Recruiting IT profiles also allowed me to understand the role of each in the birth and evolution of the product.
        
        When I'm not designing I travel (mostly alone to recharge my batteries), garden with my cat (or rather he watches me do it or rolls in the dirt) and learn watercolor and new languages. </h2>
